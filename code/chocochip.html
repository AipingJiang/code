                Chocolate chip cookies are iconic, timeless treats loved for 
                their perfect blend of sweet, buttery, and chocolatey goodness.
                 These cookies feature a golden-brown, slightly crisp exterior 
                 that gives way to a soft, chewy, and sometimes slightly gooey 
                 interior. The star ingredient is, of course, chocolate chips, which
                  melt during baking, creating pockets of rich, melted chocolate 
                  throughout the cookie. Other key ingredients include all-purpose 
                  flour, granulated sugar, brown sugar, butter, eggs, baking soda, and 
                  a pinch of salt. The dough is typically formed into small balls and 
                  then baked to perfection. Chocolate chip cookies offer a delightful 
                  contrast of textures and flavors, with the sweetness of the cookie 
                  dough complemented by the semi-sweet or milk chocolate chips. They are 
                  beloved worldwide and hold a special place in the hearts of many as 
                  the ultimate comfort food.

        <p class = "recipe">
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>Preheat your oven to 175Â°C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and 
                    brown sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, and beat well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt (optional if using salted butter).</li>
                <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until the dough comes together.</li>
                <li>Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips.</li>
                <li>Drop rounded tablespoons of cookie dough onto ungreased baking sheets. You can also use a cookie scoop 
                    for uniform sizes.</li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven for 9-11 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden but the centers are still 
                    soft. The exact time may vary depending on your oven, so keep an eye on them to avoid overbaking.
                </li>
                <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before 
                    transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
