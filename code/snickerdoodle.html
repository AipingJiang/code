                Snickerdoodles are delightful round cookies with a soft, chewy texture, 
                characterized by their pale golden-brown surface adorned with a sugary cinnamon coating. 
                These classic treats boast a sweet and buttery flavor complemented by a distinct cinnamon warmth, 
                thanks to the ground cinnamon and cream of tartar in the dough. Their preparation involves rolling the 
                dough into small balls, then generously coating them in a sugar-cinnamon mix before baking, resulting in a 
                cookie with a satisfying contrast of a crisp exterior and a tender, pillow-like center. Snickerdoodles have 
                a storied history with probable Dutch or German roots, evolving into an enduring American favorite cherished 
                for their timeless appeal, especially during the holiday season.

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p class ="recipe">
            <ol class="recipe">
                <li>Preheat your oven to 175Â°C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, baking soda, 
                    and salt. Set this dry mixture aside.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened butter and 1 1/2 cups of sugar together until 
                    the mixture becomes light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs and vanilla extract to the butter-sugar mixture and beat until well combined.</li>
                <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until a smooth dough forms.</li>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar and the ground cinnamon to make the cinnamon sugar coating.</li>
                <li>Use your hands to shape the cookie dough into 1-inch balls (you can use a cookie scoop for uniform sizes). 
                    Roll each ball in the cinnamon sugar mixture until it's coated evenly.</li>
                <li>Place the coated cookie dough balls onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving some space between each one.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden, 
                    but the centers are still soft. Be careful not to overbake.</li>
                <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring 
                    them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
