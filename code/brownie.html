            <h1>Chocolate Brownie Cookies</h1>
            <p>
                Chocolate brownie cookies are a delightful hybrid of two beloved 
                desserts, combining the rich, fudgy texture of brownies with the 
                portable convenience of cookies. These cookies typically have a 
                decadent, intensely chocolatey flavor and a soft, chewy interior, 
                reminiscent of traditional brownies. The key ingredients include 
                cocoa powder or melted chocolate, all-purpose flour, granulated 
                sugar, brown sugar, eggs, butter, and a pinch of salt. Chocolate 
                chips or chunks are often added to intensify the chocolate experience. 
                The dough is scooped into cookie-sized portions and baked until they 
                develop a slightly cracked surface but remain soft and fudgy on the 
                inside. Chocolate brownie cookies offer the best of both worlds, 
                making them a popular choice for chocolate enthusiasts who crave the 
                taste of brownies in a more portable form.

        <p class="recipe"> 
            For the Cookie Dough:
            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1 & 1/4 cups semi-sweet chocolate chips or chunks</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup chocolate chips or chunks (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 175Â°C and line one baking tray with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>
                    In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the butter and the chocolate chips (or chunks) together. 
                    You can do this in 20-30 second intervals, stirring between each interval, until the mixture is smooth. 
                    Alternatively, you can melt them in a heatproof bowl over a pot of simmering water (double boiler method).
                </li>
                <li>Once the chocolate and butter are melted and smooth, allow the mixture to cool for a few minutes.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and vanilla extract until well combined.</li>
                <li>Slowly pour the melted chocolate mixture into the egg mixture, stirring continuously until well incorporated.</li>
                <li>In another bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt (optional if using salted butter).</li>
                <li>Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.</li>
                <li>Fold in the 1 cup of chocolate chips or chunks.</li>
                <li>Using a spoon or cookie scoop, drop mounds of dough onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving enough space 
                    between each for the cookies to spread.</li>
                <li>Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the cookies are set but still soft in the middle. The exact baking time can
                     vary, so keep a close eye on them.</li>
                <li>Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for a few minutes before transferring 
                    them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
