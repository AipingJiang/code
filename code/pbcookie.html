            <h1>Peanut Butter Cookies</h1>
            <p>
                Peanut butter cookies are beloved treats known for their 
                rich peanut flavor and distinctive crisscross pattern on top. 
                These cookies typically have a golden-brown appearance and a 
                slightly crispy exterior with a soft, chewy interior. The key 
                ingredient, of course, is peanut butter, which infuses the cookies 
                with a nutty and slightly salty taste. Commonly found ingredients in 
                peanut butter cookies include all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, 
                brown sugar, butter, eggs, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. To create 
                the classic crisscross pattern, the dough is often flattened with a fork 
                before baking. Peanut butter cookies have a comforting and nostalgic 
                quality, making them a cherished favorite for peanut enthusiasts and 
                cookie lovers alike.
