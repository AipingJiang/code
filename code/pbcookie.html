                Peanut butter cookies are beloved treats known for their 
                rich peanut flavor and distinctive crisscross pattern on top. 
                These cookies typically have a golden-brown appearance and a 
                slightly crispy exterior with a soft, chewy interior. The key 
                ingredient, of course, is peanut butter, which infuses the cookies 
                with a nutty and slightly salty taste. Commonly found ingredients in 
                peanut butter cookies include all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, 
                brown sugar, butter, eggs, baking soda, and a pinch of salt. To create 
                the classic crisscross pattern, the dough is often flattened with a fork 
                before baking. Peanut butter cookies have a comforting and nostalgic 
                quality, making them a cherished favorite for peanut enthusiasts and 
                cookie lovers alike.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <p class="recipe"> 
            For the Cookie Dough:
            <ul class="recipe">
                <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup peanut butter (smooth or crunchy, your choice)</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup brown sugar, packed</li>
                <li>2 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
                <li>2 & 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 & 1/2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 175Â°C and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
                
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, peanut butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar 
                    until the mixture is light and fluffy, which should take about 2-3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Then, stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt (optional if using salted butter).</li>
                <li>Gradually add the dry ingredients to the peanut butter mixture and mix until just combined.</li>
                <li>Roll the cookies into balls, and place onto the prepared trays. If you prefer, you can use a fork to create 
                    the classic crisscross pattern on top of each cookie.</li>
                <li>Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are lightly golden 
                    (the cookies will continue to set as they cool).</li>
                <li>Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire 
                    racks to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
